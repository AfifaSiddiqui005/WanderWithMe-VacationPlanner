💡 About the Project

I created WanderWithMe as a front-end learning project.
It started as a simple HTML and CSS website and was later enhanced using JavaScript to make it more dynamic and interactive.

Main Objective:
To avoid hardcoded content and use JavaScript arrays and objects to display data dynamically.

🚀 Key Features

 Dynamic Gallery: Images are generated using JavaScript arrays and loops instead of static HTML.

 Glassmorphism UI: Uses a modern frosted-glass effect with CSS (backdrop-filter) for a clean look.

 Interactive Tips: A “View More” button reveals additional travel tips using DOM manipulation.

 Responsive Design: Works smoothly on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

 Parallax Effect: Fixed background scrolling effect adds a premium feel.

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5: For semantic and structured markup

CSS3: Flexbox, Grid, animations, and modern styling

JavaScript (ES6): DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic content rendering
